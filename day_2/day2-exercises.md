There are three main types of lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and definition. What are their differences?
Ordered lists are lists where each item is numbered.  This could be used to write out steps for a recipe
Unordered lists begin with a bullet point rather than anything that shows it should be ordered like numbers.
Definition lists are a set of terms with definitions for those terms.

What is the basic structure of an element used to link to another website?
Links use the <a></a> tags with an href attribute in the opening tag that has the link in it.  The text in between tags would be what text the user clicks on.  

What attribute should you include in a link to open a new tab when the link is clicked?
You'll want to include the target attribute and make it target="blank" to open a new tab when the link is clicked.

How do you link to a specific part of the same page?
