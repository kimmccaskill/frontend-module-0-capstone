Psychology: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
+ https://www.reddit.com/ - Start scrolling or pick a subreddit and start scrolling
- https://www.facebook.com/ - Many icons and buttons everywhere that make it less than instinctual to find what they want.

Usability: Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
+ https://www.nytimes.com/ - Great example.  Many categories at the top with search function.
- https://www.facebook.com/ - This website has developed too many functions to where it is almost difficult to get the job done.

Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
+ https://turing.io/ - High quality photos. Eye-catching visuals without having to scroll far.
- https://www.hornstash.com/ - Immediately seeing the address attached to the search function loses my trust. Also very low res photos on the homepage.

Copywriting: Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
+ https://www.econoautosale.com/ - The buttons guide you well.
- https://www.webuycarsdenver.com/ - It tries to tell me what to do in "steps" but they are not relevant steps.

Analysis: How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
+ https://www.ebay.com/ - Help AND feedback buttons on the right side of the browser.
- https://www.amazon.com/ - No options for help or feedback.
