    <h1>The Trombone</h1>
    <h2>Beginnings</h2>
    <hr />
<!-- Below paragraph has some brief info about sackbut that leads to trombone -->
    <p class="intro">Near the beginning of time, around the 1400s, emerged something unlike anything that has ever existed.
      We call this...the sackbut.
      With this heroic name inspired a glorious sound out of the flared bell of this instrument that sang in churches and public venues for centuries to come.
      From the early Renaissance to popular bands today, the essence of sackbut still remains near and dear to our hearts.</p>

      The trombone has such a well-known sound because of a technique it uses called glissando which is when it continuously slides up or down in pitch between notes.
      The other famous part of a trombone that helps it achieve the glissando is the slide.
      You may not have known what a trombone was before, but hopefully now you will be able to recognize one when you see or hear it.</p>

    <hr />
<!-- Below paragraph has uses of trombones today with unordered list including symphonies and bands of different genres -->

    <p class="content">As you can see by the picture above, the trombone has changed a lot since it's sackbut days.
    Much of the design has become more ergonomic for the player.
    The bell has become wider for a bigger sound.
    The material has become thinner for a broader sound.
    The tubing has become consistent to be pitched in Bb in A=440.
    You can even see that some trombones add an attachment for even more tubing for expanded range and manueverability.
    <br><br>
    Trombones had a huge growth in popularity due to introduction of jazz back in the 1900s.
    That era had a particular influence on a lot of the music that uses trombones today.</p>
